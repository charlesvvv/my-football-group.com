  <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Verdana;">Introduction<h2>
    <p>Flowers by Kim is a flower design company that specializes in  WEDDINGS, Events, and an unconventional approach to blessing others with flowers. Complimentary consultations are by appointment. The shop is located in a residential neighborhood and is an addition on my home with a separate entrance, located in S. Richland, Washington.
  
    <h3 style="text-align:center; ">About Us</h2>
    <p>We operate much like a small flower shop would without the overhead or regular store hours.
      Although we stay very busy with weddings, we do love the flower holidays and often run specials for Valentine's, Mother's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  We can also provide reasonably priced flowers for any event, birthdays, anniversary, get well, funeral, memorial or just because.
      Advance orders can be provided with your specific flower requests or we can provide last minute needs with our fresh weekly,  in- stock flowers.
      We prefer not to offer cookie cutter arrangements, instead we will design flowers based on your needs and often will ask you your price point.  What's your budget $25, $40, $60 or more?  Delivery is available in the Tri-Cities for $6. Our desire is to work with you to help you bless others with flowers!  Please don't hesitate to contact me via the Contact Us page, email or by phone.  Be sure to like us on facebook for news, updates on holiday sales, and specials.</p>

          style="width:200px;"><p>I have lived in the Tri-Cities since 1979. I have 11 years of banking (Gesa Credit Union) experience, and was a Senior Director with Home Interiors and Gifts for 13 years as an Independent Sales Consultant.  I helped many women decorate their homes through home parties, personal appointments, decorated business offices, and assisted builders with decorating for Parade of Homes.  I spent the 5 years between personal business ventures, working full-time at Liberty Christian School as the Office Manager and Director of Admissions, while doing weddings and prom flowers on the side.  In January 2013 I "officially" began operating Flowers by Kim full-time, by appointment.   As you can see from the Glimpses,  I love what I am doing and have helped hundreds of brides bring their wedding vision to  life.
      I began designing silk floral arrangements while I was with Home Interiors and it became one of my specialties.  I started making fresh flower corsage and boutonnieres many years back for my daughter Amber and her friends for homecomings and proms.  I decided to follow my passion and creative outlet after a daughter got married 6 years ago.  In 2011-12, I worked on call for a local flower shop for a year, helping with weddings, special occasions and floral holidays.
      I have established my client base through client and vendor referrals, bridal shows, word of mouth, and social media. I especially enjoy doing weddings and receptions.  I have a workshop and consultation room built onto my home to meet with potential clients for complimentary consultations.
